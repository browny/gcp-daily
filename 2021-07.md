🗞️ Introducing improved maintenance policy for Cloud Memorystore [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/cloud-memorystore-gets-more-control-over-maintenance-timing)]

> For each Cloud Memorystore instance, you may set an optional preferred **maintenance window** when updates are scheduled

> In addition to selecting the preferred maintenance window, users can subscribe to maintenance notifications for advanced notice when an update is scheduled. After an update is scheduled, subscribed users will receive an email notification with the date and time of the scheduled maintenance. At this point, you can begin to plan for the upcoming maintenance update, **opt to undergo maintenance sooner than the scheduled date, or defer maintenance by up to one week after the originally scheduled time**

🗞️ Monitor models for training-serving skew with Vertex AI [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/monitor-models-training-serving-skew-vertex-ai)]

「Vertex AI 提供偵測 training-serving data skew 的工具，及早發現 serving 資料處理端的錯誤 or 需要重新 training model」

> Turn on skew detection for a model deployed in Vertex AI’s Online Prediction service. No prior pre-processing tasks are required. Just run a command with a few basic parameters to turn on monitoring

> Training-serving skew is a difference between model performance during training and performance during serving

> Thus, one of the most important MLOps lessons Google has learned is: continuously monitor model input data for changes. For a production ML application, this is just as important as writing unit tests

🗞️ Getting the most out of Cloud IDS for advanced network threat detection [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-ids-helps-detect-advanced-network-threats)]

「Cloud IDS 使用指南」👨‍💻

> Cloud IDS uses Packet Mirroring to copy and forward network traffic, and Private Service Access (PSA) to connect to a set of cloud-native IDS instances which exist in a Google managed project. **This allows a Cloud IDS to be seamlessly integrated into an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) network without needing to change the VPC design**

> When creating the Packet Mirroring Policy to attach to your Cloud IDS, **there are three options to select the mirrored sources: subnets, tags, individual instances**

> Inside a Packet Mirroring Policy, **there is an option to filter traffic**. There are some use cases, however, where filters may be quite useful. For example, consider the case where you want to have different alert severities for trusted and untrusted remote networks

> Cloud IDS offers flexibility when attaching Packet Mirroring Policies. **Multiple Packet Mirroring Policies can be attached to the same IDS Endpoint**

> If your organization has a centralized networking and security team supporting various projects, and multiple projects require IDS coverage, consider using a Shared VPC. **By using a Shared VPC, a single Cloud IDS can support multiple projects as these projects share network resources, including Cloud IDS**

> Cloud IDS inspects not only the IP header of the packet, but also the payload. In the case where the payload is encrypted, such as with HTTPS/TLS/SSL traffic, consider placing the application behind a L7 Internal Load Balancer (ILB) or HTTP(S) External Load Balancer

🗞️ Building with Looker made easier with the Extension Framework [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/building-looker-made-easier-extension-framework)]

🤯 Bringing Kubernetes’ goodness to Windows Server apps with Anthos [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/windows-server-support-comes-to-anthos-on-prem)]

> Last year, we announced support for Windows Server containers running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), our cloud-based managed Kubernetes service, which lets you take the advantage of containers **without porting your apps to .NET core or rewriting them for Linux**.

> Today, we’re going a step further with **support for Windows Server containers on Anthos clusters on VMware in your on-premises environment**. Now available in preview, you can consolidate all your Windows operations across on-prem and Google Cloud.

🗞️ Calling a private Google Cloud Function from on-prem [[link](https://medium.com/google-cloud/calling-a-private-google-cloud-function-from-on-prem-91eb628c85ac)]

> Private Cloud Functions can only be invoked by resources within the same Google Cloud project

> Instead of sending API requests to the publicly available IP addresses for service endpoints such as [storage.googleapis.com](http://storage.googleapis.com/), you can send the requests to the internal IP address of this Private Service Connect endpoint. All the calls flowing through this endpoint will behave as if they were made from within the same project
