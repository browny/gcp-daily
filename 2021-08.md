🗞️ **Six new features in Dialogflow CX [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/6-new-features-in-dialogflow-cx)]**

> With these features, our customers will be able to improve the end-user conversational experience and manage security and deployment better

Here’s a selection of what’s new:

- **Streaming partial response**: Webhook 執行時間較久的時候可以讓 agent 先回應部分內容，以面 user 覺得困惑
- **Private network access to Webhook targets**: Webhook 可以是在 Private Service Connect 後面的 endpoint，便可以用上 IAM//VPC-SC 等安全機制
- **Search in console**: 如果建很多 intents/entities 要找的話可能很困難，可以直接用這個 search
- **System functions support**: 支援 common arithmetic (算術), string manipulation (字串處理), conditional (流程控制) and date/time (日期時間) operations，可以不用都依靠 webhook
- **Continuous tests and deployment**: Using this feature, one can automatically run a set of test cases configured for an environment to verify the intended behavior of the agent in that environment
- **Change Diffs in Change History**: 加入版控機制

🗞️ **Save messages, money, and time with Pub/Sub topic retention [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/pubsub-gains-topic-retention-feature)]**

「利用 Topic retention，那些在 messages 之後才出現的 subscriptions 也可以 replay messages，太神啦 👏 」

> Starting today, there is a simpler, more useful way to save and replay messages that are published to Pub/Sub: **topic retention**. Prior to topic retention, you needed to individually configure and pay for message retention in each subscription. Now, when you enable topic retention, all messages sent to the topic within the chosen retention window are accessible to all the topic's subscriptions, without increasing your storage costs when you add subscriptions

> Topic retention extends Pub/Sub's existing seek functionality—message replay is no longer constrained to the subscription's acknowledged messages. **You can initialize new subscriptions with data retained by the topic, and any subscription can replay previously published messages**

🗞️ **A unified and proven Zero Trust system with BeyondCorp and BeyondProd [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/applying-zero-trust-to-user-access-and-production-services)]**

「Zero trust 的重點不在於不相信任何事, 而是不要把雞蛋都放在同一個籃子裡。BeyondCorp 著重 user，BeyondProd 著重 service，這兩者都有別於傳統單純依賴 network 信任，更著重在 identity 以及 context 上面」

> At the core of a Zero Trust approach is the idea that implicit trust in any single component of a complex, interconnected system can create significant security risks

> Where BeyondCorp states that "**user** trust should be dependent on characteristics like the context-aware state of devices and not the ability to connect to the corp network", BeyondProd states that "**service** trust should be dependent on characteristics like code provenance and service identity, not the location in the production network, such as IP or hostname identity"

> Updates that users perform, which are called configuration updates and updates that Cloud SQL performs, which are called **system updates**.

> In general, Cloud SQL **system updates are divided into three categories**: hardware updates, online updates, and maintenance.

> **Maintenance updates the operating system and the database engine. Since these updates require that the instance be restarted, they incur some downtime**

> To moderate application impacts, we bundle critical updates together into maintenance events that are scheduled once every few months

> To make maintenance more manageable, **we equip users with settings such as maintenance windows and deny periods**
