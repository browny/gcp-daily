🗞️ **Run more workloads on Cloud Run with new CPU allocation controls [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation)]**

「Cloud Run 新增 `CPU is always allocated` 支援 (原本是 `CPU is only allocated during request processing`)，搭配 minimum instances 可以做到更多工作類型的支援，例如: request return 之後還要執行 background job 的情景」👏

> By default, Cloud Run does not allocate CPU outside of request processing. For a class of workloads that expect to do background processing, this can be problematic. So today, we are excited to introduce the ability to allocate CPU for Cloud Run container instances even outside of request processing

> This feature unlocks many use cases: Executing background tasks and other asynchronous processing work after returning responses

> When you opt in to "CPU always allocated", you are billed for the entire lifetime of container instances—from when a container is started to when it is terminated

🗞️ **Improve gRPC service availability and efficiency with Traffic Director [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/new-service-mesh-features-with-proxyless-grpc-services-and-traffic-director)]**

「Traffic Director 針對 gRPC 推出了兩個 new features: **Retries** 和 **Session affinity**」👏

> With the most recent release of gRPC, we are bringing new traffic management capabilities to proxyless gRPC services that use Traffic Director: retries and session affinity

> **Retries** help you improve your service availability by enabling your gRPC applications to retry outbound requests according to a policy. This can be helpful if instances or endpoints (that host your server application(s)) are slow or flaky

> **Session affinity** is critical to enabling particular use cases and can also help you improve application performance and efficiency. It works by attempting to **send requests to the same backend service instance or endpoint based on the request characteristics** (HTTP headers)
