🗞️ **CloudSQL: Monitor disk availability [[link](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/using-ood-recommender)]**

「自動偵測 CloudSQL instance 的硬碟使用量」

> The Cloud SQL out-of-disk recommender proactively generates recommendations that help you reduce the risk of downtime that might be caused by your instances running out of disk space

🗞️ **Run more workloads on Cloud Run with new CPU allocation controls [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation)]**

「Cloud Run 新增 `CPU is always allocated` 支援 (原本是 `CPU is only allocated during request processing`)，搭配 minimum instances 可以做到更多工作類型的支援，例如: request return 之後還要執行 background job 的情景」👏

> By default, Cloud Run does not allocate CPU outside of request processing. For a class of workloads that expect to do background processing, this can be problematic. So today, we are excited to introduce the ability to allocate CPU for Cloud Run container instances even outside of request processing

> This feature unlocks many use cases: Executing background tasks and other asynchronous processing work after returning responses

> When you opt in to "CPU always allocated", you are billed for the entire lifetime of container instances—from when a container is started to when it is terminated

🗞️ **Improve gRPC service availability and efficiency with Traffic Director [[link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/new-service-mesh-features-with-proxyless-grpc-services-and-traffic-director)]**

「Traffic Director 針對 gRPC 推出了兩個 new features: **Retries** 和 **Session affinity**」👏

> With the most recent release of gRPC, we are bringing new traffic management capabilities to proxyless gRPC services that use Traffic Director: retries and session affinity

> **Retries** help you improve your service availability by enabling your gRPC applications to retry outbound requests according to a policy. This can be helpful if instances or endpoints (that host your server application(s)) are slow or flaky

> **Session affinity** is critical to enabling particular use cases and can also help you improve application performance and efficiency. It works by attempting to **send requests to the same backend service instance or endpoint based on the request characteristics** (HTTP headers)

🗞️ **Dataflow Prime preview [[link](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/pricing#dataflow-prime)]**

「真 serverless 的 Dataflow 來惹 🤩，計價模式也是走 serverless 的模式算 DPUs」

> Dataflow Prime is a serverless data processing platform for Apache Beam pipelines. Based on Dataflow, Dataflow Prime uses a compute and state-separated architecture and includes many new features. Pipelines using Dataflow Prime benefit from automated and optimized resource management, reduced operational costs, and diagnostics capabilities

> A job running Dataflow Prime is priced by the number of Dataflow Processing Units (DPUs) the job consumes. DPUs represent the computing resources that are allocated to run your pipeline

💧 **Release: Cloud Monitoring [[link](https://cloud.google.com/release-notes#August_30_2021)]**

> The VM Instances page features enhanced scorecards for VM health. The new scorecards now include both **"maintenance" and "system" events** that might affect your VMs and agents, along with other metrics and statistics about the health of your VMs

💧 **Release: Cloud Functions [[link](https://cloud.google.com/release-notes#August_30_2021)]**

> Cloud Functions adds support for [setting a minimum number of instances](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/min-instances), available at the Preview release level
